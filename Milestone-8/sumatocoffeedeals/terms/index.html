                    <h3>4.1 Coffee Products</h3>
                    <p>All coffee is roasted to order and shipped fresh. While we make every effort to maintain consistent flavor profiles, natural variations in coffee beans may occur due to seasonal changes, growing conditions, and processing methods.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.2 Pricing</h3>
                    <p>All prices are in US dollars and subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue products at any time.

                    <h3>5.1 Order Acceptance</h3>
                    <p>All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We may refuse or limit any order for any reason, including if the product is unavailable, there are errors in pricing or product information, or we suspect fraudulent activity.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5.2 Payment Processing</h3>
                    <p>Payment is processed at the time of order. You authorize us to charge your chosen payment method for the total amount of your order (including taxes and shipping).</p>
                    
                    <h2>6. Shipping and Delivery</h2>
                    <p>We ship orders within 1-2 business days after roasting. Shipping times are estimates and not guaranteed. We are not responsible for delays caused by carriers or unforeseen circumstances.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.1 Shipping Costs</h3>

                    <h2>7. Returns and Refunds</h2>
                    <p>Due to the perishable nature of our products, we generally do not accept returns of coffee. If you receive damaged or defective products, please contact us within 7 days of delivery for resolution.</p>
                    
                    <h3>7.1 Damaged Products</h3>
                    <p>If your order arrives damaged, please email photos of the damage to support@sumatocoffeedeals.com within 48 hours of delivery. We will evaluate the situation and determine the appropriate resolution.</p>

                    <h3>8.1 Billing Cycle</h3>
                    <p>Subscriptions are billed in advance on the same day of the month as the initial order. If a billing date does not exist in a given month (e.g., the 31st), billing will occur on the last day of that month.</p>
                    
                    <h3>8.2 Cancellation</h3>
                    <p>To cancel, log in to your account and modify your subscription settings. Cancellations must be made at least 48 hours before the next scheduled roast date to avoid being charged for that cycle.</p>
