                        <p>Alternatively, for e-mail communications, you may opt out of receiving such communications by following the unsubscribe instructions set forth in most promotional e-mail messages from us. Your unsubscribe request or e-mail preferences change will be processed promptly, though this process may take several days. During that processing period, you may receive additional promotional emails from us.</p>
                        <p><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> When you install our apps on your mobile device you can choose to receive push notifications, which sends messages to your mobile device even when the app is not on. You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile device's "settings" page.</p>
                        <p><strong>Text Messages:</strong> If you have opted in to receive text messages from us, you can opt out of SMS text communications by texting STOP. When we receive an opt-out message from you for SMS text messages, we may send a text message confirming receipt.</p>
                        <p>Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information about the Service, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Policy or our Terms of Service.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gold mt-6 mb-3">B. Opting Out of Geolocation</h3>
                        <p>If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device's settings for the relevant application or the "settings" page for the relevant game.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gold mt-6 mb-3">C. Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising</h3>
                        <p>You can opt out of third-party behavioral advertising through your device settings and other third-party opt-out tools.</p>
                        <p>If you are interested in more information about behavioral advertising and your choices to prevent behavioral web and mobile web advertising from third parties, you may visit the following websites:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                            <li>Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising: <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/" class="text-primary hover:underline" target="_blank">https://optout.networkadvertising.org</a></li>
                            <li>Your Online Choices website for EU-based advertising: <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu" class="text-primary hover:underline" target="_blank">http://youronlinechoices.eu</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you do not want to receive behavioral in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests on your mobile device, you may adjust the ad tracking settings on your device (such as turning on "Limit Ad Tracking"). You can also reset the "Advertising Identifier" (such as an IDFA) from your mobile device's settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous "Advertising Identifier." Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's "AppChoices" app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.</p>
                        <p>All of the opt-out tools described in this subsection are provided by third parties, not us. We do not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.</p>
                        <p>Please note that you may still receive third-party advertisements in our Service after using these opt-out tools, but the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

                        <p>How long we retain your personal information depends on why we collected it and how we use it, but we will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.</p>
                        <p>We will retain personal information about you that is connected with your account and/or the Service for as long as you have an active account with us. We will take reasonable measures to delete this personal information if you delete your account. However, you acknowledge that we may retain some information after you have closed, or we have deleted, your account with us where necessary to enable us to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend, or establish our rights.</p>

                        <p>We work hard to protect your information, but you also have a role to play.</p>
                        <p>We implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to help protect the security of your information both online and offline and to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. These measures vary based upon the sensitivity of your information.</p>
                        <p>If you have an account registered directly with Ruby Seven your profile information is protected by the password you use to access your account. It is important that you protect and maintain your Ruby Seven account's security and that you immediately tell us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your Ruby Seven account, the Service allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. If you access our Service through a social network and your social network account is hacked or otherwise compromised, this may lead to someone accessing or deleting your Ruby Seven account without your permission. So, be careful to keep your social network account information, including your social network account password, secure as well. We urge you to log out of your Ruby Seven account and any social network account you have used to access our Service when you are finished using them.</p>
                        <p>When you sign into your Ruby Seven account or enter payment information, we and our third-party payment processor use encryption to transmit that information.</p>
                        <p>While we take precautions against possible security breaches of our Service and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our Service. Any transmission is at your own risk. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please Contact Us.</p>

                        <p>If we decide to make material changes to our Policy, we will tell you and other players by placing a notice in-game or on www.rubyseven.com or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you before the change becomes effective (and we will ask for your consent where required by law).
