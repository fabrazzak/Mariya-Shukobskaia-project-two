                    <h2>3. HOW INFORMATION IS USED, SHARED AND DISCLOSED</h2>
                    <p>Unimob Studios does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent. Except as set forth in Section 10 of this Privacy Policy, parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as Unimob Studios does not share information that may be collected from your child. Unimob Studios uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the Unimob Studios Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of UnimobStudios's business. Examples of how Unimob Studios shares and discloses your information is as follows:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Legal</h3>
                    <p>Unimob Studios may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise UnimobStudios's legal rights. Unimob Studios may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when Unimob Studios believes that disclosure is necessary to protect UnimobStudios's rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. Unimob Studios may share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of UnimobStudios's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
                    <p>As Unimob Studios continues to develop its business, Unimob Studios may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of UnimobStudios's assets are acquired or Unimob Studios merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that Unimob Studios reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, Unimob Studios will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control</h3>
                    <p>Unimob Studios may use third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on UnimobStudios's behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, processing payments, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Unimob Studios will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. Unimob Studios shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    
                    <h2>4. SECURITY</h2>
                    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to UnimobStudios. Unimob Studios follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to UnimobStudios, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, Unimob Studios cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security system is completely secure, Unimob Studios and its third-party partners and vendors take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by UnimobStudios.
