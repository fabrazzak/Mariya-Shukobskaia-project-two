                            <li>To respond to your inquiries.</li>
                            <li>To fulfill your orders, facilitate redemption of Rewards, and for other customer service purposes</li>
                            <li>To track your play activity and progress in our games.</li>
                            <li>To provide personal hosted services to you.</li>
                            <li>To track Application crash events and for other quality control purposes.</li>
                            <li>To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to offer location customization, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the Site, Applications, or our Services.</li>
                            <li>Where permitted by law, and in accordance with Facebook's applicable terms and conditions, for marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may use your information, such as your email address, to email you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or information we think may interest you.</li>
                            <li>To assist in determining where to advertise our Services on third party websites. When we engage an ad service to advertise our games, we submit hashed "suppression lists" so that we aren't sending ads to players who are already playing our games. The suppression list contains hashed Ad IDs. Hashed data converts a string of characters to data of a fixed length using an algorithm.</li>
                            <li>To better understand how users access and use our Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Services, analyze player traffic and activity, respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.</li>
                            <li>To understand the effectiveness of our ads. For example, if you installed one of our Applications because you viewed a mobile ad, we will use information to identify the third-party ad network that displayed the mobile ad for us.</li>
                            <li>We also may post to your Facebook Wall, access posts in your news feeds, and access your Facebook data when you are not logged into Facebook. We will use and access this information for the purposes described in this section and as discussed below.</li>

                        <h2>11. How We Share Your Information</h2>
                        <p>We may share the information that we collect from or about you as follows:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Fellow PLAYSTUDIOS App Users on Facebook</h3>
                        <p>Your username and profile picture will be visible to all other PLAYSTUDIOS users who use our Applications on Facebook, regardless of whether they are your Facebook friends.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Our Rewards Partners</h3>
                        <p>When you redeem a Reward, we may share certain of your information with our Rewards partners in order to facilitate the provision of the Reward to you and for the purposes stated at the time you redeem the reward. Any information that you submit to a third party will be governed by that Rewards partner's privacy policy and not this Notice.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
                        <p>We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf ("Service Providers"). For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We use Amazon Web Service and the Simple Storage Service (S3) to store information about you and your activities in our applications on databases.</li>
                            <li>We include SDKs within our Applications that transfer game transaction data to third-party service providers who monitor crashes and create error logs so that we can maintain the Applications.</li>
                            <li>We use a third-party service provider to receive support requests and transfer them to us via email.</li>
                            <li>We use third-party service providers to help us with ad attribution. The service provider receives information about how our ads are viewed and interacted with and whether the viewer downloads, installs and interacts with any of our Applications.</li>
                            <li>We use third-party service providers to facilitate running our own ads, as well as third-party mobile ads in our Applications.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
                        <p>If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company.</p>
                        
                        <h3>In Response to Legal Process</h3>
                        <p>We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena, or to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. When we do so, we comply with EU and UK data protection law.</p>
                        
                        <h3>To Protect PLAYSTUDIOS and Others</h3>
                        <p>We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service or this Notice, or as evidence in litigation or other proceedings in which PLAYSTUDIOS is involved.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Aggregate and De-Identified Information</h3>
                        <p>We may share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Other Disclosures</h3>

                        <h2>12. Third-Party Sites and Services</h2>
                        <p>Our Site, Applications, and other Services contain links to third-party websites, applications, and services, and allow certain kinds of interactions between the Services and third-party content, web sites, applications, platform, code ((e.g., plug-ins, application programming interfaces ("API"), and software development kits ("SDKs")), and Tracking Technologies (collectively, "Third-Party Services"). Any access to and use of such Third-Party Services is not governed by this Notice, but instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those Third-Party Services. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.</p>

                        <h2>13. Ad Vendors, Networks and Partners</h2>
                        <p>We may use Service Providers and Third-Party Services to assist us in placing advertisements on our Services, as well as displaying advertisements on other websites or mobile applications. This includes advertisements based on your activity across time and sites and services (including our Site, Application, and Services) ("Interest-based Advertising"). These Vendors and Third-Party Services include third-party ad network providers, and/or traffic measurement services, as well as advertisers, sponsors, and other ad partners ("Ad Partners"). Our Vendors, Third-Party Services, and Ad Partners may use Tracking Technologies to personalize advertising content to you, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to carry out other aspects of ad delivery (such as limiting the number of times you see an ad, or frequency capping). In addition, we may provide certain personal information to these parties in order to facilitate the foregoing ad activities. For example, we may send a list of hashed email addresses that are used by one of these parties to help show an ad to you or for the other ad activities described in this Notice. Sometimes, we may use a list of hashed email addresses as a "suppression list" so that we aren't sending ads to players who are already playing our games. In addition, we may provide these parties with information about your usage of our Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personal information about visitors to our Site and users of our Service. The Third-Party Services' and Ad Partners' use and other processing of your information is governed by their respective privacy policies, not this one.</p>
                        <p>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> (NAI) and <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (DAA).</p>
                        <p>Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites accessible by the above links.</p>
