They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owners. Cookies typically contain the name of the website they come from, their "lifetime" (how long they stay on your device), and a value, which is usually a randomly generated unique number. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

                        <p class="mb-6">When you first visit our Site, you will be presented with a cookie consent banner that allows you to accept all cookies, reject non-essential cookies, or customize your cookie preferences.

                        <p class="mb-6">Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked. Currently, our Site does not respond to DNT signals because no common, industry-accepted standard for DNT has been adopted by regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting a DNT signal. We will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
