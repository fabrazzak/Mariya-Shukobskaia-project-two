                        <h3 class="text-xl font-display font-bold mb-2">5.1 Partnership Agreements</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">All farm partnership opportunities described on our Site are subject to separate written agreements ("Partnership Agreements") that will contain the complete terms and conditions governing the partnership. The information on our Site regarding farm partnerships is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute a binding offer or create any contractual obligations. Any preliminary discussions, property evaluations, or estimates provided by Bee Central are non-binding and subject to change based on formal assessment and the terms of the final Partnership Agreement. Bee Central reserves the right to reject any potential partnership for any reason at its sole discretion.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-display font-bold mb-2">5.2 Property Evaluation</h3>
                        <p class="mb-6">Free property evaluations provided by Bee Central are preliminary assessments only and do not guarantee partnership eligibility. Final determinations regarding partnership suitability will be made after thorough on-site evaluation, soil testing, water analysis, and other agricultural assessments. You acknowledge that participation in our farm partnership program may require significant land modifications, long-term commitments (typically 10-15 years), and adherence to specific agricultural practices as outlined in the Partnership Agreement. Bee Central makes no representations or warranties about the potential profitability or success of any partnership arrangement.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-primary mb-4">6. Product Sales</h2>

                        <p class="mb-4">All orders placed through our Site are subject to our acceptance. Your receipt of an order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason, including but not limited to: limitations on product availability, errors in product or pricing information, suspected fraudulent activity, or inability to ship to your location. In the event we cancel your order, we will attempt to notify you using the contact information you provided and will refund any amounts charged for the canceled order.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-display font-bold mb-2">6.2 Pricing and Payment</h3>

While we strive to ensure all pricing information is accurate, we cannot guarantee the absence of errors and reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or on your behalf through the Services, at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You are responsible for any taxes applicable to your transactions. We accept various payment methods as indicated on our Site, and you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any payment method you provide.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-display font-bold mb-2">6.3 Shipping and Delivery</h3>
                        <p class="mb-6">Shipping times, costs, and available methods will be displayed during checkout. Title and risk of loss for all products ordered by you will pass to you upon our delivery of the products to the carrier. We are not responsible for any delays in delivery due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to: acts of God, natural disasters, war, civil unrest, labor disputes, transportation delays, or governmental actions. Some locations may have restrictions on honey imports; it is your responsibility to ensure that our products can be legally imported to your location. We do not guarantee that our products are appropriate or available for use outside Australia.</p>

                        <p class="mb-6">These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Western Australia, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the courts of Western Australia, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or additional terms and conditions or policies published by Bee Central on the Services, constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Bee Central regarding the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Services.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-display font-bold mb-2">12.2 Waiver and Severability</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">No waiver by Bee Central of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Bee Central to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-display font-bold mb-2">12.3 Assignment</h3>
